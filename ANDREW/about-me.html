        <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
       <p>My name is Olumodeji Andrew, an undergraduate of Crawford University studying Computer Science. I prefer reading books, novelty items and periodicals. I study and research alot because i grew up getting engrossed with it and i fancy asking germane questions. I am slim in stature, tall in height that is 6'4 to be precise, partially light skinned and have an ectomorph-like appearance. I despise many things and enjoy self-isolation. I am a boring and an awkward fella who prefers isolation rather than socializing. I have very few friends who seem to put up with me everytime and i find each and every one of them fascinating. I think that'll be all from me.</p>
